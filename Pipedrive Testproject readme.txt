The project took about 17 hours of coding. Estimated was about 25h.
Time for just reading and learning libraries is not included.

The time distributed as such:
(Tracked with Toggle)
35min - creating project base and installing components
2h 40min - creating UI
3h - polishing UI and tiny improvements
1h 20 min - improving structure, cleaning code
57 min - making the page dynamic
1h 8min - connecting backbone to project
30 min - testing out backbone
7 h - backbone connections to Pipedrive API

As seen from the list, most of the time was spent connecting pipedrive with
backbone. As I had never worked with backbone before, some of the code may be
suboptimal.

A lot of time was also spent trying to find the best fields from Pipedrive API,
that would fit right. In the end, I didn't find the main company field from anywhere,
I assume it can be fetched through company_ID then. I was also not sure how to get another
users "Deals" without having their key, so the deals part only shows one user's deals.

The first half of the task was not difficult for me. The second half got a bit trickier and
I had to read up a lot more and watch tutorials. Doesn't mean I didn't like it.
The hardest part for me was working the Pipedrive data with backbone.
The easiest part for me was creating the main Interface.

Over all I think that the created site serves it's purpose and is up to standards.
The UI looks clean, custom URLs work and the data reading and manipulating is mostly
done. Of course there is room for improvement, especially with backbone and data handling,
but that's exactly why I applied as a junior FE dev - I wan't to improve.
